	<<!----- INSERT YOUR NAME HERE ------>>
	Lab 12

	Directions:
	1. This application has bugs. Edit my code so that the program compiles and runs.
	2. Comment every line of code.
	3. Add code or modify the code so that the following output is achieved:

	Sample output with odd number:

	This program will check if a number is even or odd...
	Please enter in a whole number...
	3
	The number 3 is odd...


	Sample output with even number:

	This program will check if a number is even or odd...
	Please enter in a whole number...
	2
	The number 2 is even...

	
	Note:
	Preserve the indentation of the code. 
	Clean java code has:
	 proper indentation
	 variable declaration at the beginning of the program
	 class name starts with a capital
	 comments that explains the logic
