It's a nice afternoon on February 15th, 2018 and you walk into your Computer Science 290 class... \n
Everything appears to be normal but you notice that your teacher is acting a little off... \n
You look around and you noticed...SOMETHING WEIRD! \n
Wait a second... How many students are in the class with you? \n
